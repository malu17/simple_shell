# Team Project - Simple Shell

This is ALX-Holerton's team project and it is about writing a simple UNIX command interpreter.

## Information

###	1. Compilation

The shell is compiled this way:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

###	2. Operation

The shell works like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```

###	3. Output

* The shell has the exact same output as `sh` (`/bin/sh`) as well as the exact same `error` output.
* The only difference is when an error is printed, the name of the program is equivalent to argv[0].

Example of error with sh:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```

Same error with this shell:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```
